# Schooly

Schooly is an under-production web application, aimed to make the process of Online Learning easier for teachers and students. It helps teachers manage and communicate with their classroom and students, and also helps students submit their homework and stay connected with learning at school. It currently involves creation of "classrooms", where teachers can post assignments in PDF and .docx (future), and notices or announcements for the entire classroom to see.

Students can see the created assignments and notices in the integrated PDF viewer, and can also download it on their computer.

An interesting and useful feature I am working on and plan to release in the future is an attendance calendar, for both teachers and students. Schooly will also include creation of multiple classrooms under one admin account, and a better, statistical dashboard for both the teacher and students.

I plan to rebuild it with the MERN stack, instead of React.js and Firebase (current). It is still under-progress.
